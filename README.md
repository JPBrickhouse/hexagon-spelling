A game inspired by, but not affiliated with, the New York Times "Spelling Bee": [https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee).

I reverse engineered the gameplay logic and built a responsive page and dynamic user interface.

Hexagon Spelling is a MERN stack application (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) deployed on Heroku.
